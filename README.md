### About

This project was developed for my personal use in setting up a Ethereum development enviroment and reading from the blockchain using web3. I have deployed it to GitHub so that fellow MatrixCoin developers can more easily work on smart contracts. This repo is part of a tutorial they recieved that is not available publicly.


### Install instructions:

Run the following command:

    npm install

Run start.bat. One of the command terminals will prompt you for a password. This password will be for your coinbase account. After that, the setup is complete.

### Usage instructions:

Run start.bat whenever you wish to develop. A server is hosted at http://localhost:2020, and the RPC client for geth is hosted at http://localhost:2302. Mist will automatically connect to the test-net.
